    <h3>Educator at Geekster</h3>
    <p>
        In my role as a Geekster Educator, I had the privilege of guiding high school students through the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I made these complex subjects accessible with relatable examples, sparking their curiosity. During a hands-on session, the students coded a chatbot, witnessing their creation come to life. We discussed the vital aspects of ethical AI, delving into bias and diversity in tech. This workshop not only instilled a passion for AI and ML but also nurtured a sense of responsibility. It was gratifying to empower these young minds, equipping them to use technology for the greater good.
